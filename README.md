## Goals

* A tool for user engagement that collects questions concerning the refugee-situation in Austria
* Involve the audience already in the origination process of stories
* Giving people the opportunity to raise their voices not only in the comments on Facebook after the story is finished, but have the opportunity to shape the reporting with their questions.
